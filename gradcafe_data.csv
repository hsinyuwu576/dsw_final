For future applicants: the day before I received an acceptance email, I went onto ACORN and noticed that there was a little ""invited"" in orange text next to my degree registration status. The next day, I checked the SGS portal (the one you use to check your application status) and it had an update. A few hours later I got the email notifying me that there was a change. Sharing these minor details to try to demystify this process! I know how desperate I was for any nuggets of information.

However, she also said that her email was meant to be a follow-up on my official decision notification that I should have received at this point, but my portal still reflected ""under review"" status until my rejection letter was finally uploaded on 4/17. I still have yet to receive the normal notification email that the Director said I should have received prior to her reaching out with well-wishes.
Despite this admissions mess, in my experience, LA is a true rarity in Academia. She is both a brilliant researcher and a fantastic mentor and human being. Sending the biggest congratulations to her accepted applicant!"

My impressions of the program during interview day make me not mad about this result though. They very much tried to sell us their program, without allowing us to ask questions and catering to us. My three interviews resulted in a grand total of four questions, two generic ones by the faculty, and two more specific ones by the students. I am assuming I did not get accepted because one of these student questions was what non-psych non-textbook non-fiction book do you read, and I made it clear that I had attention difficulties and thus did not read often. If they use that to judge someoneâ€™s aspirations for learning, that says a lot about their program while also speaking to poor accessibility and inclusion. Every other interview day I have been to has asked better questions and seemed to acknowledge how much I loved learning. Just because someone cannot focus for hours on a book does not mean that they donâ€™t love learning."

Please accept this email as formal notification that your application for admission the Graduate School in the Psychology - PHD program has been declined. 
Admission to our Psychology - PHD program is extremely competitive and we are not able to accommodate all qualified candidates. The difficult decision surrounding admission involves a holistic assessment of all required application materials (e.g., previous experiences, GPA, letters of reference, a description of your career aspirations, etc.). Against this information, we seek a fit with our faculty who have shared scholarly goals and are available to work with additional students. We take our role in mentoring students seriously. There is a limit to how many students that any faculty member can adequately serve at one time. Unfortunately, we were not able to make that match for you. Please do not consider this decision as an indictment of your qualificationsâ€”we were simply unable to find a good fit for you in this program, given our current resources.
We do applaud your initiative in seeking a graduate credential at the University of South Carolina and extend our best wishes as you continue to pursue your academic, personal, and professional goals."

York University,Quantitative Psychology,Masters,F23,Accepted,2023-01-20,3.30,,,,2023-01-20,"Canadian applicant, did my undergrad at York. GPA for first 2 years of undergrad was significantly lower than the latter years, contributing to a lower/mediocre cumulative GPA.  Took all research methods/statistics courses offered to undergrads. Also recently did well in a university advanced stat/programming class (taken as a non-degree student in prep for grad school). Have 4 years post-bac full-time research coordinator experience (working in psychiatric research hospitals), managing large studies. Have 8 academic conference poster presentations (many were 1st author), currently have 2 publications under review (one 1st author); both papers are not on methods or quantitative psychology per se but do involve personally applying intermediate statistics to topics of interest. Met with the PI of interest back in September, just informal meeting about research interests. On January 20 I checked MyFile which said I was ""admitted"". I then reached out to the grad coordinator to see if this was correct, as I didn't receive any notice of formal interviews and did not receive any formal offer letter even though MyFile said admitted. Grad coordinator responded that same day with an offer letter. Have been rejected from programs in past years."

This year we received nearly 300 applications for just 4 positions. Our Admissions Committee conducted a holistic review of each application and has had to turn away many impressive candidates. We want you to know that while your application was considered strong, and made it through our third round of reviews, we will not be able to consider your application further.

 Applications that did not reach the final review or interview stage, while being strong, may not have been perfectly aligned with faculty research interests or provided the best fit with the program. These applications met our minimum standards and more but may not have been as competitive as others for these reasons and others (e.g., less than average research experience, or selection of a mentor not taking students)."

We want you to know that while your application was considered strong, and made it through our second round of review, we will not be able to consider your application further.

 

Applications that did not reach the final review or interview stage, while being strong, may not have been perfectly aligned with faculty research interests or provided the best fit with the program. These applications met our minimum standards and more but may not have been as competitive as others for these reasons and others (e.g., less than average research experience, or selection of a mentor not taking students)."

University Of Minnesota,Psychology,PhD,F21,Accepted,2022-05-02,,,,,2022-05-02,"My most recent principal investigator was extremely emotionally abusive, manipulative, invalidating, and gaslit me constantly. After she submitted her letter of recommendation for grad school, I reached out to HR and the Disabilities Resource Center at my institution immediately. They were able to draft a list of accommodations for me, and my abusive supervisor was initially on board.
Months passed, with irritations/disrespecting boundaries/accommodations, but I wanted to stick it out until I got into grad school and she promised me my first first-author publication. I committed to school but still decided to stick it out until the end for that first author pub, but then Wednesday was my last straw.
She downright disregarded an accommodation, HR was even copied on the email thread, she gaslit me and told me that I need to be â€œdesensitizedâ€ to her using all caps to convey urgency and demand me to do tasks, and that I need to be available constantly for impromptu meetings. HR told me to quit at that point, told me I am under no contract, and that I donâ€™t even need to put in my two weeks, so I did.

Therefore, we are not proceeding with interviews at this point the way we would in a typical year. We appreciate your patience and will provide you with further information as soon as it is available"".

Received rejection email today confirming they're taking a smaller class. Feels immoral to have people go through the application process/pay application fees and not let them know you may only take a very small class or no class at all until months later."

""I am writing to offer you enrollment in the M.A. program in Psychological Science at the Catholic University of America (CUA).

I am sorry that your application to our clinical psychology Ph.D. program was not successful. However, we were very impressed by your experiences and qualifications, and we would be thrilled to have you join our Psychological Science M.A. program.

In fact, as the Director the M.A. program, I am emailing to inform you that I have reviewed your application and I am prepared to admit you to the M.A. in Psychological Science program.

Information about the program can be found on our website

As stated on the website, the Psychological Science M.A. program is an ideal way to gain additional research experience, take doctoral-level classes, and possibly get clinical experience, all with our nationally-renowned CUA faculty and with institutions in the Washington, DC area. You would have the opportunity to work in the research lab of the faculty member with whom you expressed interest when you applied to our Ph.D. program.

Upon completing your degree, you should be a much stronger applicant for a Ph.D. program in psychology.  Graduates from our M.A. program in Psychological Science who applied to doctoral programs have been very successful.  In fact, two years ago, we had a match rate of 100%, including all of our M.A. students who applied to clinical psychology Ph.D. programs!

***If you are interested in applying to our M.A. program, please reply to this e-mail and indicate that you would like your application for our clinical program to be transferred to the M.A. Psychological Science program.  There is no additional charge and no additional materials required.***

I would be happy to speak with you further about our program"""

University Of Washington,Clinical Psychology,PhD,F22,Rejected,2022-03-18,,,,,2022-03-18,"Thank you for your application to the University of Washington Graduate School. 
Your application to the doctoral program in Psychology at the University of Washington has been reviewed by the faculty of the area designated in your application. 
Unfortunately, we are not able to recommend your admission to the Dean of the Graduate School. Since we make offers of admission to only about 20 out of more than 1000 applicants, many very well qualified applicants must be turned away. 
On behalf of our colleagues, we thank you for applying to the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington, and wish you well in the pursuit of your educational goals."
UNC - Greensboro,Clinical Psychology,PhD,F22,Rejected,2022-03-18,3.50,,,,2022-03-18,"Thank you for applying to UNC Greensboro. We strive to conduct a fair and thoughtful review of every applicantâ€™s achievements, talents, recommendations, and academic and professional credentials. After thorough review, I regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you admission at this time.

Each application is considered in relation to other applications in the same area and only the very top applicants are admitted. Your application file was considered in detail by myself and the faculty in Psychology. While we were impressed with the potential demonstrated through your application, the number of qualified applicants far exceeded the number of students we are able to enroll, so we had to make very difficult admissions decisions. In conversation with the admissions committee in Psychology, they recommend that you consider reapplying to the program for the next available entry term.

We truly appreciate the time and effort you put into your application. While I realize this is not the outcome for which you had hoped, I wish you the best toward attaining your goals."

Mentor emailed to set up a time to meet over Zoom to ""share news"". Received official offer of admission through the portal on March 3rd. For future applicants: it is helpful to better understand Harvard's admission process by going to their ProTip page on their website (it explains how, unlike most other programs, a mentor ""recommends"" you for admission, and then it has to pass through 2 committees before you are approved/notified). So it takes a little longer than possibly other programs to hear your decision after interview day. Hopefully this is helpful!"

Perhaps the LA campus is better but I would be leary to anyone thinking about the master level programs at Pepperdine.

BIPOC students shared white faculty AND students were racist and aggressive towards DEI; the few faculty of color looked like they were being held hostage and didnâ€™t really share much, and an older student said the director of the training clinic was blatantly racist and mistreated students without consequences. Not to mention the quality of the training in the clinic, based on her presentation, felt lacking. All red flags w/ this program, which is honestly disappointing bc I thought very highly of it before interview week. Anyways, hope this helps some ppl, stay as far away from this program if you can.

A number of factors are considered in evaluating each applicant, including the following: a student's undergraduate preparation, scholarship average, requisite test scores, whether the research interests of faculty are relevant to those of the applicant, and whether an applicant can be accommodated by the department to which application is made.

Unfortunately, it is not possible for the university to accept all who apply, and each department must screen applications carefully to find the best qualified students. For this reason, many excellent applicants must be denied admission.

If you have questions, please contact the Graduate Program in Education. I sincerely hope that you will be able to pursue your academic training at another institution."

The individual interviews were mostly relaxed and conversational."

I've been waitlisted and rejected and both times my gut was like nope this didn't go in my favor (not sad or upset or complaining). Just wondering if anyone could read the situation before the results were handed out.

The interview day was remote. Had 3 30min staff interviews and 3 30min sessions with current students/alum. Staff asked several interview questions about my ability to tough it out through a long/challenging program.  Was also asked 1) how I navigate conflict with supervisors/professors, 2) what my research experience is and how prepared I feel for the dissertation process.  Can't remember other questions but they were pretty standard.

We regret to inform you that your application for this graduate program was not successful.

Each year, many good applicants are declined admission to the University of British Columbia. Common reasons for declining applicants include unavailability of appropriate faculty advisors and/or funding for the applicant, an applicantâ€™s less competitive academic record, and simply the limited number of spots available in graduate programs.

Due to the significant number of applications we receive, we are unable to provide applicants with specific explanations for being declined.

We wish you well in your future endeavors. Thank you for your interest in pursuing graduate studies at the University of British Columbia.

Yours truly,"

Stanford University,Clinical Psychology,PhD,F22,Interview,,4.00,,,,2022-02-09,"to the stanford poster below and whoever else this may benefit: hi. I can give you some insight. i have gotten 9 clinical phd interviews this year at top schools. I would try not to rush this process. you said you were a senior last year? or last time you applied recently? i have over 18 publications because I took 3 years to do post bacc research. in that time, i've published first author papers, presented at conferences, and learned A LOT. I've really honed in on the work i want to do research wise, and know that wherever i end up i will be ready to hit the ground running in my projects and papers, etc. I would advise since you're SO close to getting in (waitlisted/short list), if it doesn't work out again... do more research. email P.I.s....find a research job that is in line with your future research goals and go for it. make it known you want a position in their lab (even if it unpaid. i did this and worked part time to get the experience in that lab). i have over 5 years of full time paid research experience (2 while i was in school working full time in a NIMH funded lab, i got very lucky). This is most important for these schools. I attribute my getting so many interviews at top schools to my research experience. and also life experience. i also have several years of clinical but obviously the research is more important and i've got that, too. if it doesn't work out this year, continue on the path. get a full time NIMH or equally funded research job, if you have one.... tell your PI you have an idea and write papers, present posters, do side projects/ side work, learn pre processing and how to analyze data, etc. it will shine through in your interviews and CV. it will pay off as it has done for me. and i've seen many people through the years of being in labs go through this process and you're right - it is grueling and frustrating, but what i saw was that they didn't get as many options (3-5 interviews tops) because they were rushing it. the fact i've taken the time has allowed for so many options this year. just stay the course and it will work out. that's the best advice i can give."

Stanford University,Clinical Psychology,PhD,F22,Wait listed,,,,,,2022-02-09,"IGNORE SCHOOL NAME AND STATUS, UNRELATED TO THIS POST.  I really could use some insight... It seems like my only options right now are waitlists...  I am on three schools' ""short"" waitlists.  One PI I applied to work with told me that they invited 4 people to interview for their lab and that was the limit due to COVID.  She said she has a short waitlist with SIX other people on it!  I am not sure how many students she would be looking to take but I would assume just one.  I am thinking based on the school it is likely that others will reject an offer to it but in that case, how likely is it that I would get an interview even considering four people were invited to the official interview date to begin with?  I have kept in contact with this PI before apps were due and after apps were due.  She knows I have a very strong interest in the school and with her work and has said I would be a great fit for her lab (I am a little shocked I did not get invited to the official interview day as I have a good standing GPA, almost 3 years of research experience, and multiple years of clinical experience with growing leadership and responsibility roles throughout these positions).  What are people's experiences with waitlists in general?  Any insight is appreciated, this process is driving me crazy! (This also is my second year applying to PhD programs.  I came really close last year despite still being in my senior year of college.  Now I am in my ""year off"" and have gained a lot more research experience.)"

This year we reviewed 222 applications.  Our faculty are always impressed by the quality of a large number of applicants and struggle with making very fine distinctions among worthy future professionals.  We evaluate all aspects of a candidateâ€™s dossier - GPAs, letters of recommendation, statements of intent and interest, diversity statements and CVs, etc.  With this information, we determine, to the best of our ability, which candidates would flourish and â€œfitâ€ in our program.  Indeed, due to the nature of a scientist-practitioner training model that values apprenticeship, we must carefully select a few students to consider further.  This year, we will interview around 30 applicants, with an ultimate goal of having an incoming class of from four to six students.  We must painfully put aside dozens of students who will ultimately represent and shape the future of our profession.  Unfortunately, we were unable to include you in the group of applicants selected for an interview and you are no longer being considered for admission to the program."""

Your credentials were very carefully reviewed and evaluated, and decisions were based upon many factors, grade point averages, letters of recommendation, your personal statement, and how your research interests matched our faculty. No single factor dominates our considerations, and it is the total picture, based on all available factors, that serves as the basis for our decisions.

Because we admit, on average, only four students into the Clinical Program each year, competition is extremely keen and many highly qualified applicants cannot be admitted.

On behalf of the Clinical Program, I want to thank you for your interest and extend our very best wishes for your future."

Thank you for your application to the School Psychology Ph.D. Program at the University of Massachusetts Boston. We are writing with the unfortunate news that we are unable to offer you an interview for our 2022-2023 doctoral cohort.

 

We had an extremely large pool this year and could not offer interviews to all of our amazing applicants. We are sensitive to the fact that applying to graduate school is time consuming and requires effort and commitment. Although we are unable to offer an interview for our Ph.D. program, we would be glad to review your application for admission to our masterâ€™s program is that is of interest to you. If it is, please let us know.

The qualifications of the applicants this year were simply amazing! All of the challenging academic work and research efforts represented in the applications were very impressive. As a result, there are many candidates for admission that are very promising scholars; yet, we cannot accommodate all who are qualified.

I regret to say that you will not be offered admission to the program this year. Over 1,000 students applied, and about twenty will comprise the entering class this fall. A major factor in admissions is the fit of the student to the faculty scholars we have in residence, even though many candidates show the dedication, achievement, and preparation needed to succeed in graduate school.  My hope is that you will find a good match with another program or another route to the bright future ahead of you!"

I've been working in research for over 5 years, with over 15 publications, 3 first authors, etc. Work as an RA first. write papers and posters. learn about research... if you enjoy it because clinical is not about becoming a clinician, but a scientist. We are all trying so hard to produce significant publications. i graduated in 2016 after going back to school for a different degree. worked in multiple labs. i have a disability/am a minority applicant but not the right minority, i guess. I graduated with a 4.0 gpa. i have multiple interviews last year and didn't get in. It's very frustrating to hear that ppl are applying to clinical phd programs with little to no research experience and getting in bc they fit the demographic schools are looking for at this time. Do the work, first. Then apply."

Due to our extended winter break, the recent COVID outbreak, and other challengesâ€‹â€‹â€‹, our admissions process unfolds somewhat later than other programs. We are currently in the process of finishing our review of applications. We will meet as a committee in mid-February to select applicants to invite to our interviews. If you are selected, you can expect a phone call and/or email from a potential mentor mid-February (at least two weeks before interviews days).
*Our interview days are now Monday 2/28 and Friday 3/4*.  Applicants invited for interviews have a full day of interviews with multiple faculty and students. All interviews will be conducted by Zoom.
We thank you for your interest and look forward to meeting many of you."

It's largely about the ""fit"" and how successfully an application conveys this through the Personal History Statement, Statement of Purpose, and letters of recommendation. But there are other factors at play, with the biggest being the limitation on how many new students we can bring in each year.  Most of our faculty can consider having only one new student and sometimes don't offer admission to any."

McGill University,School And Applied Child Psychology,Masters,F21,Rejected,2021-03-31,,,,,2021-05-04,I'm simply posting this for posterity and for future applicants applying to this program because the selection process and application timelines post-submission are ambiguous. McGill does not conduct formal interviews for this program as part of their selection process but some POIs may contact prospective applicants to speak with them on an informal/formal basis (It's very POI specific over there as some POIs may have informal meetings and other POIs may have formal meetings prior to an offer of admission. The department then sends out an email with a letter of recommendation (informal acceptance) around late March (it was March 18th this year). Rejections come out close to April 1st (Mine came out on March 31st). Hopefully others find this information helpful!

"Long Island University, CW Post",Clinical Psychology,PsyD,F21,Wait listed,,,,,,2021-03-09,"This is what I just received:

""If you are receiving this email, a final decision has not yet been made on your application to the Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program for the Fall 2021 cohort. We had over 400 applications this year for just 25 spots in the 2021 cohort. In order to ensure that we do not admit more students than we have spots for, the program has modified the way in which we time interviews, moving to a rolling interview process (wherein we begin admitting some applicants while still interviewing more).

This process should in no way suggest to applicants who receive interviews later in the process that their application is not up to standard for doctoral consideration. If you receive an interview - we believe your application demonstrates your potential to begin and complete doctoral work. We simply control the interview process in order to maintain a smaller class size - as our capacity (in terms of resources and faculty supervisors/advisors) is limited to our 9 core faculty members. In order to maintain a high level of rigor in our program, we must maintain these smaller cohort sizes. Our goal is to build a fall 2021 cohort whose personal, professional, and academic experiences up to this point are diverse, whose readiness for doctoral work is demonstrated, and whose commitment to the field is clear. 

For those who, in the end, do not receive an interview offer, this could be the result of a few factors: (1) the applicant pool is larger than usual this year and the class has been filled (2) your application suggests that you are not ready for doctoral-level work (3) you application suggests that you may need more clinical experiences to be ready to begin this kind of program. In any case, if you do not receive an interview, we will be glad to offer you feedback on your application after the entire 2021 application process is over. We may be able to suggest other options for the fall to you at that time - in some cases that may be another program at LIU in the mental health field, in others it may be more clinical or graduate-level academic experiences. 

If you have any questions, please let me know. If you have already decided on other plans for the fall, you can let me know that as well. If you would like us to move your application to another mental health field program at LIU (Clinical Art Therapy & Counseling, Clinical Mental Health Counseling, ABA, or Social Work), you can let me know that. There is no need to express continued interest in the PsyD program in response to this email -- if we do not hear from you otherwise, we will assume you would like us to keep your application in the 2021 pool for PsyD. 

Be well."""

Really surprised to see that many people DO NOT get into these programs directly from undergrad - shocked with how competitive counselling psychology is experience wise.. not only do you need amazing grades, good references and a strong letter, you also need 2-3 years MINIMUM of experience based off of everyone who says they have gotten an interview (some people have 5-7 years and an additional masters). For anyone looking to apply for Fall 2022 Counselling Psychology or Psychotherapy - prepare yourself, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get in.

I had a hard time understanding some of your posts. It sounds like your intense emotions for this subject have affected your grammar. Could it be possible that your SOP or CV had grammar errors or other flaws that made it hard to understand for the faculty? 
School Psychologists need to be very detail oriented so they may have noticed that.

Yeshiva University,School Psychology,PsyD,F21,Interview,,,,,,2021-02-24,"TTPP: I think what the person was trying to point out was that without proof it is hard to speculate that the reason you were not selected for an interview or for admission were due to your race. If you go off the NASP website it does seem that Yeshiva is admitting many more white students than other Phd or PsyD programs in NYC. 
The NASP website says that 13% of the students at Yeshiva (14 out of 106) are of a minority background. That is compared to 37/70 at Fordham (52%), 26/81 (32%) at St. Johns, or 35/112 (31%) at Pace. 

But then again maybe minority students are choosing to not apply to a program that is at a private religious university with a history of being anti LGBT?

Also White Supremacy has nothing to do with asking someone for more info when they accuse a program of deliberately not accepting minority students."

The fact that youâ€™re sitting here and posting massive paragraphs accusing schools of racism, and putting other applicants down is very inflammatory and immature. Also, schools do read this and iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re either incredibly entertained or find your comment to be defamatory and offensive.

Women of color and men of color in school psychology is underrepresented and are needed given that slot fo then students are diverse and billingual. So yes only admitting students who are not diverse or lack multicultural competence should be looked at programs should be striving to follow nasp guidelines in producing coursework in how to train the strudents in this area.

Interesting to see other POIs are giving off a similar vibe. I think this is the danger of not fully-funded PhD programs- you are essentially working with an advisor who has no stock in if you succeed or fail and therefore doesn't have to be super invested. I'm sorry you had a similar experience, it definitely wasn't fun for me to go through that.

So thatâ€™s a lot of loans to take out for this school. They said the area around the school is very expensive so you may have to live farther away. Also, a lot of the professors focus on psychoanalysis and thatâ€™s not really my thing and they have more practicum hour requirements. This is a great school and will be the perfect match for some people, but it just isnâ€™t the one for me. I hope this helps and if you have any questions, repost your question in the forum and Iâ€™ll private message you!"

I've spoken to several professionals in the field about it and nobody else has ever heard of anything like this happening!

Professor started the interview by saying that due to ""poor planning"" he did not review my resume beforehand so he didn't know what any of my experience is. Graduate student I met with says that over the past year, they have only met with this advisor once and he is generally unavailable. They made it clear that this program is not fully funded, but when I asked about scholarship opportunities during the faculty interview the professor basically discouraged me from applying and said students almost never get them... also just generally rude, was on his phone during the whole interview, didn't really have any questions prepared, made it clear if I'm interested in pursuing independent projects he wouldn't really be there to help.

We have not reached this decision easily. We examined all applications conscientiously, accepting for each program those applicants who appeared to have the greatest potential. As always, and unfortunately, we had to deny admission to many applicants with very strong credentials.

I sincerely hope that you will continue your studies at another institution and I wish you success in your career. I am sorry that we were unable to give you a favorable reply to your application for study at Illinois."

This if you look at the schools in New York City and in New York you will see that they are diversifying with populations that are multicultural and had minority groups the representation should be seen and should be heard. I think you should really reflect and try to find a way to understand others and understand the diverse group you see a lot of programs in the city talk about bilingual where is the black community where is the Asian community representation where is the Latino representation there is none our field is 98% white and we need to change that we need to make a change and to fight and to make sure that our children are minority children are taken care of and they will not be taking care of these white professionals because they do not understand the bilingual the multi cultural competence when you are why you do not take classes that focus on this area so I think you should stay in your lane stay in your lane and stick to what you know

Yeshiva University,School Psychology,PsyD,F21,Other,,,,,,2021-02-11,"To the poster below. 
You are absolutely right. We do need more students of minority backgrounds in school psychology and honestly more men too since the field is like 98% white women. 

That being said admissions is holistic and I am sure that they admitted the most qualified applicants who fit the program regardless of background. The program does not have the obligation to only admit students of a minority because then our field that is hurting for people to enter the field wouldn't have the capability of staffing all positions. Not to mention how unethical it would be to only admit people of minority backgrounds. 

Please dont imply that a program was racist or anti-minority because they did not extend an invite. You simply have no way of knowing that was the case."

Thank you for submitting an application for consideration to our Combined School-Clinical Child Psychology, PsyD program at the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology at Yeshiva University!

Unfortunately, we have reached the end of our period of extending interview offers to applicants for Admission to the Fall 2021/Spring 2022 academic year and I am sorry to say we will not be able to take your application to the next step of the admissions process. The competition was especially difficult this year and we were only able to extend a few interview opportunities when compared to the large number of applications we received.  We appreciate the time and effort you placed into submitting an application to our program!

I definitely encourage you to apply again next year and I would be more than happy, wherever possible, to answer any questions you have about our admissions process and your application.

We receive the number of slots from the GSAS and there is an internal faculty ranking system in the Psych dept to determine which faculty will be able to use those slots. In the absence of the April 15th resolution this year, we expect to implement a waitlist, so some faculty may be able to offer admission after initial decisions are sent out and even past April 15.

Faculty are currently reviewing applications and conducting interviews. Interviews (whether via phone, Zoom, or in-person) are always part of the admissions process for our eventual admits, but not all applicants will receive an interview. We expect interviews to take place through next week. Admissions decisions will be sent out in early March."""

She was filled with rudeness and racist comments. My friend who is white reached out to her and she was very fourth coming and kind and offered a phone call. Applicant should apply with caution in the future, I donâ€™t find this to be a good fit for black women or brown women as well. I am not sure, why she lacked humility and why a director is in charge and lacks diversity, multicultural compotence. Sad, because it says she is a billingual track.

Regardless, I wouldn't be accepting an interview invitation from the University of Hartford because I was admitted to the Clinical Psychology PsyD program at my first-choice school (I already enrolled). I just read the long comment below and thought I would share my experience. I'm sure this is a great school with a great program but I do not appreciate how long it's taking them to decide on all applications, while all other schools I applied to with later deadlines have already given everyone their decisions, including the school I committed to.

John Jay College Of Criminal Justice,Clinical Psychology,PhD,F21,Other,,,,,,2021-02-09,"The discrepancies at CUNY with the John Jay applications has to do with admissions. I know two people who had an issue with admissions, neither issue has been resolved, and admissions has stopped responding to one of my friends completely. One of the issues is that what was submitted to the admissions committee was not the full application that was submitted, but admissions won't comment on what happened accept to refute what the admissions committee stated. Other people at CUNY have been contacted but no help. Admissions is basically trying to ride out until offers are made because it's less illegal to mess up someone's application than to mess up an offer of admission so once those are out they can say oops there's nothing we can do. They're getting an attorney to compel them to answer something because admissions not responding at all is the most abhorrent treatment of someone I have ever seen and it's obvious they messed up their application. They need to be ashamed on so many levels. If the person who had the rejection letter sent to the wrong email were to make the same inquiries I have no doubt they would eventually ghost them, too. It seems like what they do when they mess up. Asking for a refund on the application would not be out of the question."

This is by far the least diverse and most awkward program I have ever encountered. 
They require a diversity essay for the application, but have an almost all white primary staff and student body. 
The current student who interviewed me was boring and awkward. The director of admissions says ""um"" and ""uh"" constantly while speaking. One of the professors was late to the orientation part of the application.

This program is perfect if you're interested in emphasizing the child/adolescent track. Otherwise... They have the depth of a piece of white bread. Any POC's that get admitted will certainly be diversity admits."

The difficulty of selecting candidates for the interview stage was further magnified given the overall excellence of the pool and the limited number of interview slots.

We are never able to admit or even interview all the applicants who we believe are qualified and talented. This year, we were able to invite fewer than 10% of applicants for interviews.
